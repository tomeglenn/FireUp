# FireUp
A lightweight UDP Client/Server library

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to provide an extremely lightweight UDP Client/Server library implementation that can work well with Unity 3D. Therefore this library targets .NET 3.5 but can be easily upgraded should you wish to use the latest version of Unity 2017 (which can target .NET 4.6.1).
